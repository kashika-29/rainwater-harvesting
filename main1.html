    <li><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Artificial Trees</h2></li>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;"> An imposing canopy of artificial trees up to 50 meters is high towering over a vast urban oasis.
        
        The colossal solar-powered supertrees are found in the Bay South garden: it is part of a 250-acre landscaping project – Gardens by the Bay – that is an initiative from Singapore’s National Parks Board that sees the cultivation of flora and fauna from foreign lands.
        
        The man-made mechanical forest consists of 18 supertrees that act as vertical gardens, generating solar power, acting as air venting ducts for nearby conservatories, and collecting rainwater. To generate electricity, 11 of the supertrees are fitted with solar photovoltaic systems that convert sunlight into energy, which provides lighting and aids water technology within the conservatories below.

    <li><h2 style="font-size: 40px;"> Rain Barrel</h2></li>
    <P style="font-size: 25px;" >A rain barrel is a storage container used to collect rainwater from your roof.
         It helps conserve water and can be used for various purposes such as watering lawns, gardens, and indoor plants
         Rain barrels are containers designed to trap and store rainwater. They can be huge, 
         complex systems that use pumps and linked barrels for storage, or single plastic or wooden drums that catch rainwater swirling along roof gutters and out of downspouts.</P>

         <li><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Glass Wall Fountain</h2></li>
         <p style="font-size: 25px;">Unlike other indoor water features, glass wall fountains do not require frequent cleaning or upkeep. 
            The water is contained within a sealed glass panel,which helps to prevent buildup and keep the fountain looking its best.
            Glass wall fountains have been growing in popularity in recent years as a way to bring the tranquility and beauty of nature indoors. These stunning pieces of art combine the peaceful sounds of flowing water with the elegant, shimmering beauty of glass to create a captivating display.

            The idea behind glass wall fountains is to create an indoor environment that is both calming and visually appealing. These fountains are designed to mimic the natural flow of water in a stream or waterfall, with water cascading down a glass panel and pooling in a basin below.
             The result is a soothing and mesmerizing display that can transform any room into a peaceful oasis.</p>

        <li><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Fog harvesting for irrigation</h2></li>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Rain isn't the only form of water that can be harvested from the sky. In Villa Lourdes, Peru, village farmers are reducing their dependence on water-carrying diesel trucks by using large sails to capture condensation from the fog.
             And these aren't insignificant amounts. Just one panel can capture 200 and 400 liters a day — a pretty good haul for a water-scarce region.
            These are just some of the neat ways that innovators and tinkerers are capturing and conserving water.</p>
