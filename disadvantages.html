        <li><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Challenge Regarding Artificial Tree</h2></li>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;" >Balancing daylight for plants to flourish with intense solar gain on the equator.
            Cooling and dehumidifying the hot and humid air for the domes without imposing a large carbon footprint.
            Cleaning the Supertrees using drones equipped with hosepipes.
            Ambitious goals: Singapore's alternative energy goals are difficult due to its reliance on fossil fuels.
Lush streetscapes: The city's lush streetscapes have been disrupted by the construction of artificial trees.
Engineering services: The Supertrees provide an armature for engineering services, which may impact the skyline4.
Land reclamation: Singapore's landmass has grown through reclamation, impacting its natural environment

        <li><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Challenges Regarding Rain Barrel</h2></li>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Small size which limits the potential rainwater collection volume.
            Need to link multiple rain barrels together to increase the rainwater collection capability, which increases the connection points and the opportunity for failure or leaks.
            Constructing a rain barrel can be a laborious endeavor when viewed in terms of its collection efficiency. The main disadvantage is their small size which really limits the potential rainwater collection volume.
            To increase the rainwater collection capability, you would need to link multiple rain barrels together which increases the connection points and the opportunity for failure or leaks.
            Constructing a rain barrel can be a laborious endeavor when viewed in terms of its collection efficiency.
            Mosquito and other insect growth can be a problem especially for homemade rain barrels where attaching screens and such may be difficult to install properly</p>
        <li><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Challenges Regarding Glass Glass Wall Fountain</h2></li>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Hydraulic Design Complexity: Water movement in fountains isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about precision engineering. Designing a hydraulic system that controls water flow, pressure, and direction is a highly specialized task. Engineers must calculate the exact force needed to achieve the desired water effects, whether it’s a delicate mist or a towering geyser. Errors in hydraulic calculations can lead to uneven water flow, system failures, or even safety hazards.
            Structural Integrity: Large-scale fountains can be massive structures that need to support significant water weight, often in dynamic motion. Engineers must ensure that the structure of the fountain can withstand constant exposure to water, extreme weather conditions, and wear and tear. Materials like concrete, steel, and specialized waterproof coatings are chosen not only for their aesthetic appeal but also for their durability and ability to withstand the rigors of fountain operation.
            Electrical and Lighting Systems: Modern fountains are often equipped with sophisticated lighting systems that create dazzling night-time displays. Integrating electrical components within a water environment is inherently risky, requiring meticulous planning and waterproofing to ensure safety. The challenge extends to programming the lights, synchronizing them with water movements, and ensuring the system can be easily maintained and repaired.</p>
        <li><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">Challenges Regarding Fog Irrigation</h2></li>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Accurate fog forecasting is challenging due to sensitivity to various processes across different scales.
            Fog harvesting, a sustainable water collection method, uses atmospheric moisture in fog-rich regions to address water scarcity challenges.
            Fog irrigation improves environmental sustainability by reducing water and carbon footprint, especially in greenhouses.
            The connection between drought, heatwaves, and catastrophic floods poses challenges for fog irrigation systems</p>
